## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Project Proposal (draft 1)](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2023/proj500.html) is due to Canvas at 7 PM on Wednesday 2023-02-22.
    - You'll also present your idea orally in class on 2023-02-23 (this "presentation" will just be you briefly summarizing your data source, outcome, treatment and covariates from your seat - no slides and it shouldn't take more than two minutes, each.)
    - The second and final version of your Proposal is due on Wednesday 2023-03-08.
2. Lab 3 is due to Canvas at 7 PM the following Wednesday 2023-03-01.

## Can I Still See Your Show?

We have fewer than 20 seats available for each of our final two performances of The Play That Goes Wrong, this Friday and Saturday at 8 PM. Visit https://www.auroracommunitytheatre.com/ for tickets.
