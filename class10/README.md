## Today's Rosenbaum Discussion: Chapter 9 (Sensitivity to Bias)

In one of Dr. Love’s papers using matched propensity-score analysis, a significant result was obtained favoring the treatment group over a control, and the calculated sensitivity parameter value was 1.5. Now imagine that you did a study and obtained such a result. Provide a basic description of your imaginary study’s population, outcome, treatment and covariates so we can follow your logic. Provide a description of what that value means in English, and discuss how your reaction to the study and its importance might differ if the significance level was unchanged but the sensitivity parameter had instead been 1.1, or 2.0.
