# Your Questions, My Answers

- Should I let you know in advance if I have to miss a class, or part of a class?
    - If you know you're going to miss time during or for an entire class, an email in advance would be helpful.
    - This is a bigger problem in March/April than in January/February because I do most of my lecture work in the first 6-7 classes.
- Will we be allowed to use our own data for class assignments/projects? 
    - For the project, yes, assuming it fits with [the project requirements](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2023/proj500.html).
