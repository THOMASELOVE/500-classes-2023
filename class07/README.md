## Today's Announcements and Materials

1. Today's class is offered via Zoom only. See Canvas or your email for the link.
2. The Right Heart Catheterization example we'll discuss today is now refreshed for 2023. Details are available [on our 500-data page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/rhc).
    - The original paper is Connors Alfred F et al. 1996 [The Effectiveness of Right Heart Catheterization in the Initial Care of Critically Ill Patients](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-classes-2023/blob/main/sources/articles/Connors%20et%20al%201996%20JAMA%20The%20Right%20Heart%20Catheterization%20Study.pdf) from the *Journal of the American Medical Association*
3. We will talk a bit about [covariates in your Project Proposals](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-projects-2023/blob/main/proposal1.md) to help set you up to complete the final version of your proposal, due Wednesday 2023-03-08.
4. I'll talk a a bit about extensions to matching ideas, using today's slides. 
    - One reference I'll use is Hansen Ben B 2004 [Full Matching in an Observational Study of Coaching for the SAT](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-classes-2023/blob/main/sources/articles/Hansen%202004%20JASA%20Full%20Matching%20in%20SAT%20Coaching.pdf) *Journal of the American Statistical Association*
5. Ben Kramer has changed his choice of paper for OSIA, and this has been amended on [our OSIA claims page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-osia-2023/blob/main/claims.md). 
6. The [OSIA scheduling / second reader form](https://bit.ly/500-2023-osia-schedule) now reflects this change, and is due at noon on Monday 2023-03-06. 
    - I will interpret the votes I already have which included the old paper (Hiraoka 2017) as votes instead for the new paper (Zeitler 2023) so you don't need to revote. 
    - At the moment, I have votes from everyone except **Catherine, Jack, Jacqueline and Millenia**. Take some time today to get this done, if you can, so we don't have to wait until next Monday.
7. To set you up for OSIA presentations, we'll spend a little time with the paper below:
    - Kubo Yusuke et al. 2020 [Effects of preoperative low-intensity training with slow movement on early quadriceps weakness after total knee arthroplasty in patients with knee osteoarthritis: a retrospective propensity score-matched study](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-classes-2023/blob/main/sources/articles/Kubo_2020_extra.pdf) *BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation*

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [OSIA scheduling / second reader form](https://bit.ly/500-2023-osia-schedule) is due at noon on Monday 2023-03-06. Take some time today to get this done, if you can.
2. [Project Proposal: Final Version](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2023/proj500.html) is due at 7 PM on Wednesday 2023-03-08.
3. [Lab 4](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2023/lab4.html) is due Wednesday 2023-03-22 at 7 PM. 
    - Our Lab 4 answer sketch will assume you've done the cleaning the way we did it in the [Lab 3](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2023/lab3.html) answer sketch, which will be posted **by class time** to our Shared Drive in Quarto and PDF.

## Thanks

for your patience with me. I hope to be back to normal next week.
