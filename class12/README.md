## Today's Rosenbaum Discussion: Chapter 8 (Quasi-Experimental Devices)

Provide an example of how the method of multiple control groups might be used to improve the design of an observational study with which you are familiar, either one you have been directly involved in, or one you’ve read about, or one you’d like to be able to do. Provide a basic description of your study’s population, outcome, treatment and control conditions and covariates of interest so we can follow your logic. Be sure to specify the approach you would take in implementing multiple control groups, and the ways in which you expect the use of multiple control groups to be helpful in improving your understanding of the phenomenon you’re studying.

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. Your [Final Project Presentation](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2023/proj500.html#the-presentation) is either on 2023-04-27 or 2023-05-04.
