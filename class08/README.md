## Today's Agenda

1. We'll quickly verify the schedule and plans for OSIA presentations. [See here for the schedule](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-osia-2023/blob/main/claims.md).
2. The [Right Heart Catheterization example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/rhc) is now complete, including the sensitivity analysis material.
3. We will discuss sensitivity analysis for matched samples.
4. We will discuss the status of your project proposals, the "final" version of which you submitted last night. 
5. We will also discuss Rosenbaum Chapter 7. There is an [essay prompt for Chapter 7](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-2022/tree/main/essays#prompt-for-chapter-7-elaborate-theories), which is worth looking at in advance, but there is no need to pre-develop an essay for Class 08.

Remember that next week is the CWRU Spring Break. We will not hold class again until two weeks from today: 2023-03-23. I will check email only daily during the Break.

## Sensitivity Spreadsheet Information

- The Excel sheet (developed in 2008) is available in our Shared Drive in the Sensitivity Spreadsheet folder.
- The PDF description of what the spreadsheet does (with examples) is also found in our Shared Drive in the Sensitivity Spreadsheet folder.
