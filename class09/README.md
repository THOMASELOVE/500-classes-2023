## Today's Rosenbaum Discussion: Chapter 11 (Matching Techniques)

Describe the most important thing (or things) that you learned from reading Chapter 11 that you didn’t already know from our in-class discussions of matching. In particular, specify how this new material might change your approach to your future work, ideally in the context of an actual study you’re doing (perhaps your project) or a study you hope to do in the future.
